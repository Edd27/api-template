# Node.js REST API template

This GitHub project template is designed to kickstart your Node.js REST API development.
It provides a set of essential files to help you maintain a clean and organized codebase for your Node.js REST API project.

## Features

1. **Directory structure:**
   - `/src`: This directory is where your Node.js application source code should be placed. It's organized into subdirectories, such as `/controllers`, `/dto`, `/routes`, `/services` and `/utils` to keep your code modular and maintainable.
     - `/config`: Configuration files, environment variables, and any other settings needed for your application.
     - `/test`: This directory is for your unit and integration tests using a testing framework.
2. **Package.json:**
   - Includes a well-defined package.json file that lists dependencies and scripts for common development and production tasks.
3. **ESLint and Prettier configuration:**
   - ESLint and Prettier are pre-configured to help maintain code quality and consistency.
4. **Git ignore:**
   - A `.gitignore` file is provided to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment.
2. Install the project dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`.
4. Run an instance of postgres with docker with:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword postgres:latest
   ```

   If you already have a postgres server installed, just modify your `.env` file with the credentials of your postgres instance.

5. Init migration with `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`.
